# C++20 solutions to Advent of Code 2021 #

This repository contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/). The code is written in C++20.

The source file(s) for each day are in their own directories. There is no build system or anything like that: just `cd` to a directory and compile using the command line. The solutions have been tested with GCC 11 and AppleClang 13. They may or may not work with MSVC.

Most of the solutions use work-in-progress functional programming library called [libflow](https://github.com/tcbrindle/libflow).
